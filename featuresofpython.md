## **10 Features of Python**

1. **Simple and Easy to Learn**
   Python has a simple syntax that is easy to read and write, even for beginners.

2. **Interpreted Language**
   Python executes code line by line, which makes debugging easy.

3. **High-Level Language**
   The programmer does not need to manage memory or system architecture.

4. **Platform Independent**
   Python programs can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS without changes.

5. **Object-Oriented Language**
   Python supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

6. **Large Standard Library**
   Python provides built-in libraries for file handling, math, networking, and more.

7. **Dynamically Typed**
   No need to declare variable data types explicitly.

8. **Open Source and Free**
   Python is free to use and has a large community support.

9. **Extensible and Embeddable**
   Python can be extended with C/C++ and embedded in other applications.

10. **Supports Multiple Programming Paradigms**
    Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## **Why Python? (Importance of Python)**

1. Python is easy to learn and suitable for beginners.
2. It is widely used in **software development, data science, AI, ML, and web development**.
3. Python helps in faster development due to simple syntax.
4. It has strong community support and extensive documentation.
5. Python is highly demanded in the job market.

Here’s the **latest Python version (as of January 2026)** and how Python versioning works:

---

## ✅ **Latest Stable Python Version (January 2026)**

✔️ **Python 3.14.2** — released *5 December 2025* **(latest stable)** ([Python.org][1])
This is the most recent stable numbered version you’d normally install and use. ([Python.org][1])

👉 There are also **Python 3.13.x** releases (like 3.13.11) that are actively maintained, but 3.14.2 is the newest major stable version. ([Python.org][1])

There may be **alpha/beta releases** of future versions (e.g., 3.15 pre-release), but these are **not recommended for production**. ([Real Python][2])

## 🔢 **Python Versioning Explained (How Python Versions are Numbered)**

Python version numbers have this structure:

```
MAJOR . MINOR . MICRO
```

### **1. Major Version**

* The first number (e.g., `3`) is the **major version**.
* Python has been in the **3.x series for many years** (Python 2.x is obsolete). ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][3])

### **2. Minor Version**

* The middle number (e.g., `14` in 3.14.2) is the **minor version**.
* These are usually released **once per year** with new features. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][3])

### **3. Micro Version**

* The last number (e.g., `2` in 3.14.2) is the **micro/revision release**.
* These are **bug fixes, patches, and security updates** to the minor release. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][3])

So:

📌 **Python 3.14.2** means:

* **3** = major version (Python 3)
* **14** = minor version (released in the 2025 series)
* **2** = patch update with fixes since initial 3.14.0 release ([Python.org][1])

---

## 🕒 **Version Life Cycles**

Python releases are supported in phases:

* New release → full support (bug fixes + security fixes)
* After some time → **only security fixes**
* Eventually → **End of Life (EOL)**, no more updates

For example:

* Python 3.12 and 3.13 are currently supported. ([devguide.pythonlang.cn][4])
* Older versions like 3.9 have reached EOL. ([planetpython.org][5])
